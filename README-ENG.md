# Secret Sing-Box

[**Russian version**](https://github.com/PeacedoseDev/Secret-Sing-Box/blob/main/README.md)

### Trojan and VLESS proxy with TLS termination on NGINX or HAProxy

This script is designed to fully configure a hidden proxy server with [Sing-Box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org) core and [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) or [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org) camouflage. Two setup methods:

- All requests to the proxy are processed by NGINX, the requests are passed to Sing-Box only if they contain the correct path (WebSocket transport)
- All requests to the proxy are processed by HAProxy, the requests are passed to Sing-Box only if they contain the correct Trojan password (TCP transport) â€” [FPPweb3](https://github.com/FPPweb3) method

Both setup methods make it impossible to detect Sing-Box from the outside.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recommended OS: Debian 11/12 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04. You will also need your own domain linked to your Cloudflare account ([How to set it up?](https://github.com/PeacedoseDev/Secret-Sing-Box/blob/main/cf-settings-en.md)). Run as root on a newly installed system. It's recommended to update and reboot the system before running this script.

> [!NOTE]
> With routing rules for Russia.

### Includes:

1. Sing-Box server setup
2. NGINX or HAProxy reverse proxy and website setup on port 443
3. Security setup (optional)
4. Cloudflare SSL certificates with auto renewal
5. WARP setup
6. Enable BBR
7. Client Sing-Box configs with routing rules for Russia
8. Automated management of user config files
9. Optional setup of proxy chains of two or more servers

### Usage:

To configure the server, run this command:

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeacedoseDev/Secret-Sing-Box/master/install-server.sh)
```

Then just enter the necessary information:

![pic-1-en](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18df9322-28f7-44f3-87bf-28ee45cb0693)

The script will show your client links in the end.

---

To display additional settings, run this command:

```
sbmanager
```

Then follow the instructions:

![pic-2-en](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b951dd-504c-4650-b699-353971021b7d)

Options 4 and 5 synchronize the settings in client configs of all users, which eliminates the need to edit the config of each user separately.

To enable AdGuard DNS on the client, use option 5 and specify "tls://94.140.14.14" instead of "tls://1.1.1.1" in the config template. This may reduce performance due to slower domain resolution compared to 1.1.1.1.

### WARP+ keys:

To activate a WARP+ key, enter this command (replace the key with yours):

```
warp-cli registration license CMD5m479-Y5hS6y79-U06c5mq9
```
